[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/omichelsen/typescript-mocha-sinon-nyc.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Boilerplate project for TypeScript library tested with Mocha. Shows how to wire up supporting libraries like nyc for coverage, sinon for spies and chai plugins for more natural test expressions. It also shows how to use proxyquire to mock imports not under test.
